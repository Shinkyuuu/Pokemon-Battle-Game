# Pokemon-Battle-Game
This is a game I made as a project during my freshman intoduction to Python course. The code is very disturbing to look at, but I am still proud of end result regardless. This was before I knew of multi-file programs, so this one Python file contains 2000+ lines of code. Many of which are reduntant but this was during the infancy of my study of programming.
